## Overview

\tableofcontents

# vikingClasses.py

## Implementation 

- class `Soldier(health, strength)`
  - `attack()` -- returning `strength`
  - `receiveDamage(damage)` -- reducing `health`
- class `Viking(name, health, strength)` -- inherited from `Soldier`
  - modified `receiveDamage(damage)` to print damage received, name and possible death
- class `Saxon(health, strength)` -- inherited from `Soldier`
  - modified `receiveDamage(damage)` to print damage received and possible death
- class `War()`
  - `addViking(Viking)` and `addSaxon(Saxon)` to fill up lists
  - `[viking|saxon]Attack()` to simulate effects of attack actions
  - `showStatus()` to test whether any army has been depleted


### Deviations from the task

- dealing with death
- utility of battle cries

## Dealing with death

- test suite expects health values below < 0 <!-- --> in `receiveDamage(damage)` methods  

::: {.block}

### Failing 4-testsWar.py

```
self.assertEqual(self.saxon.health, 
     oldHealt - self.viking.strength)
AssertionError: 0 != -90
```

:::

- we consider this unrealistic and treat 0 health as absolute minimum
  - `receiveDamage(damage)`: `health` set to 0 if `damage>health`
  - checking for `health==0` in cleanup of deceased in `War.[saxon|viking]Attack()`


## Utility of battle cries

::: {.block}

### Project requirements

- battle cry is purely symbolic (simple shout)
- no effective impact on battle
- not used by default

:::

::: {.block}

### Our implementation 

- probabilistic use in `War.vikingAttack()`
- use increases strength/damage dealt by fixed value (3)
- adds a further random element, strengthening `Viking` instances

# Simulation logic

## Overall approach

### Design goals

- interactive choice of size for each army
- random property allocation of health and strength of Soldier objects within pre-defined ranges
- non-deterministic attack order


## Structure

1. importing necessary packages (random, vikingClasses)
2. instantiating variables
3. defining auxiliary function for army creation
4. main program
   - greeting
   - creation of War instance
   - input logic for army sizes, army creation
   - action simulation loop
   - final result output

## Variables

- `namelist`: list of names for Viking instantiation
- `valuedict`: dictionary of dictionaries for the following values for Saxons and Vikings
  - `num`: number of soldiers to create, instantiated as `None`
  - `health`: tuple of range for random health values
  - `strength`: tuple of range for random strength values
- `groups`: auxiliary list of ["Saxon","Viking"] for simplication of army raising

## Auxiliary function

::: {.block}

### `raise_army(num, group, war)`

Raises an army of type {`group`} with {`num`} members in {`war`}
    
- `num`: number of members of army to be raised
- `group`: the group the army belongs to
  - 'Saxon' for Saxon
  - 'Viking' for Viking
- `war`: a War object

:::

- each soldier is created with random values based on the constraints defined in `valuedict`


## Main loop


### Input logic

- loop through `groups`
- request size of each army
- `while`-loop to ensure valid input of integer
- call `raise_army()` function for each group


### Action simulation

- `while`-loop until `showStatus()` returns a value other than the `elsewhere` case
- use condition of `randrange(10)<6` for 60\% likelihood of triggering `saxonAttack()`, otherwise `vikingAttack()`
- output the return strings of those methods for transparency (or visual clutter?)


# Conclusions

## Possible extensions

- more detailed or less cluttered output
- more options for interactive parameter setting (possibly in menu)
  - property range brackets (health, strength) of of Viking/Saxon instances
  - probabilities for attack actions in main cycle
  - probability and strength of battle cry in Viking class
- game-like direction: 
  - defense values
  - upgradability
  - healing
  - two-player mode (semi-round-based?)
- simulation-like direction: 
  - introduce meta-iterations of game loops to generate larger datasets of the effects of property settings
  - reduce outputs
  
## Difficulties, lessons learned?

- use the tests and grow beyond them
